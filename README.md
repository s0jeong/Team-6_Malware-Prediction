Introduction:

In the modern digital age, the flow of information is so rapid and vast that the complexity and variety of cyber threats are increasing day by day. Cyber threats are having a serious impact on a variety of targets including individuals, businesses, and government agencies. Malware is a major component of these cyber threats and comes in many forms, including stealing personal information, compromising systems, encrypting data, and demanding money. For example, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in 2021 shut down a major oil pipeline on the East Coast of the United States, resulting in significant economic losses. Malware is causing enormous damage throughout society, and defense against it is essential.

Objectives:

This project aims to improve our ability to identify malicious software (malware) accurately and efficiently by developing a powerful machine learning model for malicious code detection. To this end, we have set the following specific goals:
1.	Data collection and preprocessing:
Collect malware and benign software data from various sources, preprocess it, and transform it into a form suitable for model training.
2.	Model development and training:
Develop malware detection models using a variety of machine learning algorithms, including regression, classification, and clustering. Gradient Boosting, including XGBoost, will be one of the key algorithms used in this step to develop high-performance models.
3.	Model evaluation and improvement:
Gradient Boosting algorithms, such as XGBoost, provide built-in evaluation metrics and hyperparameter tuning capabilities that will be leveraged to enhance model accuracy.
4.	Real-world application and testing:
Apply the developed model to real systems to detect malware in real time verify its effectiveness.
